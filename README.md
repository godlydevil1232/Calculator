# Calculator
This is creates a calculator with a GUI that can perform simple arithmetic operations.
I am using the PyQt library for implementing my GUI.To perform the operations,a stringparser class is used
(i luckily found one on the internet,did not have to go through anymore trouble)which 
uses the pyparser lib to to carry out the commands.
